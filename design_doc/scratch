Definitions:
Process invariant: refers to information that does not depend on the particular
instance of execution, i.e. task name, task dependencies, and unscaled quantity

Current action items:

Database: We wish to store all process invariant information about nodes

Cycle detection: We wish to detect if a recipe generates a cycle

Visualization system: To aid with checking ordering

Core algorithm: 
1) Topological sort
2) Schedule nodes via traversal according to CPL
3) Return reverse traversal

Prereqs:  
	  taskNode API
	  Graph generation from database
	  CPL calculator and definition
	  
CPL calculator
    CPL_i = { sum_(j is immediate dependency of i) CPL_j } + w_j

    w_j := time to perform task
