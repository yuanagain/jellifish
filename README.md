### Setup Guide

This guide will help you to install the appropriate software required for our standard development environment.

It will help you setup:

- Python 3.5.0 via `pyenv`, an automated Python-version management system
- A virtual environment via `virtualenv`

### Running the Setup

This step is simple. If you are using OS X, download and run `setup-osx.sh` in your terminal, **in the jelli.fish project folder**.

On the other hand, if you are running a Debian-based Linux OS, download and run `setup-debian.sh` in your terminal, **in the jelli.fish project folder**.

That's all!
